Dinner Room

You entered a fancy dinner room

The elegant victorian-style dining room is adorned with rich mahogany paneling and
intricate floral wallpaper, casting a warm, inviting glow from the ornate
crystal chandelier overhead. A grand oak dining table, set with fine china and
silverware, commands the center of the room, while a magnificent, gilded mirror
hangs above a marble fireplace, reflecting the flickering light of the candelabras.
To the east, a set of French doors opens onto a lush, manicured garden, and to the
 west, a heavy, carved wooden door leads to the opulent parlor, promising further
 exploration of this stately home.
